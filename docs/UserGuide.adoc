== Introduction

Task Book is a desktop task manager application that is designed for students to manage their daily tasks and ultimately, lead a more productive life. More importantly, Task Book is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Task Book can get your management of tasks done faster than traditional paper notebooks or a mobile application. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `taskbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks for that day
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add t/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Do homework`.
//* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::selectDeadline[]
=== Selecting a date: `select`

// tag::add[]
=== Adding a task: `add`

Adds a task with its title, description, priority level (low, medium, high) and the number of hours (positive integers only) expected
to complete this task, to the Task Book +

[NOTE]
====
Module code is an optional input. +
====

[CAUTION]
====
Tasks with similar deadline, title and module code are considered duplicate.
If a duplicate task is added, Task Book will give an error message: `This task already exists in the task book`

However, if the original task has no module code, you are allowed to add
a similar task with a new module code.
====
Format: `add t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION p/PRIORITY h/HOURS [c/MODULE_CODE]`

Examples:

* `add t/Complete 2113 Tutorial d/with code done p/high h/1`
* `add t/Complete 2113 Tutorial d/with code done p/high h/1 c/CS2113`

// end::complete[]

=== Delete a task : `delete`

Removes a task from the task book
Format: `delete [INDEX]`

their priority!
|===

[NOTE]
====
* Tasks will be sorted in lexicographical order for `title` and `module` sorting methods.
* Tasks will be sorted from higher to lower priority for `priority` sorting method.
* Tasks will be sorted in ascending order of deadlines for `deadline` sorting method.
* An empty TaskBook will accept the sort command.
* Sort command uses stable sorting method

====

Sort the tasks in the task book via `priority`, `deadline`, `module`, or `title` +
Format: `sort s/METHOD`

Examples:

* `sort s/deadlines`

*Before: "sort s/deadlines" is entered*

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +

// tag::FAQ_milestone[]
*Q*: Why do I get this error when I tried to add milestones with a rank of "0" or "-1"?

image::FAQ_invalidRank.png[width="790"]

*A*: You can only enter *non-zero*, *positive* integers for rank!

*Q*: Why do I get this error when I tried to add a milestone?

image::FAQ_invalidIndex.png[width="790"]

*A*: You can only add milestones to *existing tasks*! In this case, there is only 1 task entered into the Task Book, hence attempting to add a milestone to index 2 of the Task Book will result in an error!
